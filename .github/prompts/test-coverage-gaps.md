Identify the most valuable missing tests in this repository.

Backend tests live under `apps/api/tests` and run with pytest inside the stack
defined by `docker-compose-test.yml`. See `apps/api/tests/TESTING_GUIDE.md` for
conventions and fixtures.

Rank by risk rather than by raw coverage percentage. Prioritize:

1. Code paths handling authentication, permissions, or access control.
2. Data mutation paths where a bug corrupts or destroys user data.
3. Complex conditional logic with many branches and no corresponding test.
4. Recently changed code with no accompanying test.

For each gap, name the file and function, explain what breaks if it regresses, and
sketch the specific test case to add including the inputs that matter. Propose at
most ten, ordered by risk. Do not write the tests.


## Output format

This is read as a GitHub Actions job summary. Match this structure exactly —
it uses collapsible sections so the page stays short until someone expands a
finding:

1. **One verdict line**, first thing in the report: emoji + severity counts,
   e.g. `🔴 1 HIGH, 🟡 2 MEDIUM` — or `✅ No findings` if the audit is clean.
   Nothing above this line: no preamble, no restating this prompt.
2. **One collapsible block per finding**, most severe first, in exactly this
   shape (including the blank line after `<summary>`):

<details open>
<summary>🔴 <b>HIGH</b> — one-line title · <code>path/to/file.py:42</code></summary>

**What's wrong** — one to three sentences, concrete, no restating the code.

**Attack** — the exact request or scenario that exploits it. Omit this line
entirely for non-exploit findings (dead code, missing tests, versioning gaps).

**Fix**
```python
<the actual patch, not a description of one>
```
</details>

3. Only the single most severe finding gets `<details open>` (expanded by
   default). Every other finding uses `<details>` with no `open` attribute,
   so it renders collapsed and the reader clicks to expand.
4. Severity emoji: 🔴 HIGH, 🟡 MEDIUM, 🔵 LOW. Pick based on real exploitability
   and blast radius, not by inflating everything to HIGH.
5. Cap at 10 findings, most severe/valuable first. If you found more, add one
   line after the last block: "N more found, not shown."
6. If there is nothing to report, output only the verdict line and stop —
   no empty sections, no "I checked X, Y, Z and found nothing" narration.
